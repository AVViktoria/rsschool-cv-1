### CODE EXAMPLE
Three ways to solve the same problem in JavaScript:
**Object.entries from object to array ({ a: 1, b: 2 }) => [['a', 1], ['b', 2]]**
```
  1. const makePairs = (object) => Object.entries(object);
  2. const makePairs2 = (object) => Object.keys(object).map((el) => [el, object[el]]);
  3. const makePairs3 = (object) => {
     const result = [];
     for (const prop in object) {
       if (object.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
         result.push([prop, object[prop]]);
       }
     }
     return result;
    };
  const data = { a: 1, b: 2 };
  console.log(makePairs(data)); // [['a', 1], ['b', 2]]
  console.log(makePairs2(data)); // [['a', 1], ['b', 2]]
  console.log(makePairs3(data)); // [['a', 1], ['b', 2]]
```
